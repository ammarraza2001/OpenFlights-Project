Final project of CS225 by Harsh Agarwal, Kushal Khandelia, Maya Nayak, and Syed Ammar Raza

Team Contract

Communication - Team Meetings Our team will meet once a week every Wednesday from 6-8 PM at the Grainger Library. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with Harsh (harsha4). Notes will be stored on a MSWord document.

Assistance - Each team member can be contacted through email, or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.

Respect - The note-taker for the week will also serve as the leader for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

Collaboration

Work Distribution - Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.

Time Commitment - To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than five hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.

3.Conflict Resolution - All conflicts within the team will be decided by a Super Smash Bros match, Final Destination, 3 stock no items. The winner will decide who was right and who was wrong (Might makes right).
