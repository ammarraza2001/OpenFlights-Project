## Description

With this project, you can determine the following:
1. If an Airport B is reachable from another Airport A with a user-inputted number of stopovers
2. The shortest distance between an Airport A and an Airport B
3. If it is possible to visit one or more of airports Airport A, Airport B, and Airport C more than once

Please note that the OpenFlights dataset we used in creating this project was last updated in June 2014 and thus it—and this project—have purely historical value.
