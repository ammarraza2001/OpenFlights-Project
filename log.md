**April 3rd**
Our goal for this week was data processing and implementation of an algorithm covered in class. We did not accomplish these goals, as we did not account for the time it would take for us to fix our proposal and determine a viable alternative uncovered algorithm. Next week, we plan to construct our directed, unweighted graph and implement the union-find algorithm. This week, the specific tasks each member accomplished are the same; we all solely worked on fixing the proposal.

Harsh Agarwal - Fixed the graph algorithm section under proposal.md, specifically the Boruvka's algorithm and its implementation in finding a MST. Also updated the timeline to stay on track throughout the course of the final project. 

Syed Ammar Raza - Wrote the intial graph algorithm section under propsal.md based on the leading question and assisted Harsh on improving it. Updated the time complexity of the algorithms and wrote the advantages of adjacency matrix over adjacency list. Helped research alternate algorithms which we can utilize. 


**April 10th**
Our goal for this week was to write an acceptable proposal, complete data processing, set up our project (e.g. create the Makefile), and begin implementing our covered algorithm and traversal. We did accomplish these goals. Next week, we plan to finish implementing our covered algorithm and traversal. The specific tasks each member accomplished are listed below:

Maya Nayak - Worked on fixing the proposal and began implementing our covered algorithm (Dijkstra)
