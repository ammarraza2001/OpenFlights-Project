**April 3rd**
Our goal for this week was data processing and implementation of an algorithm covered in class. We did not accomplish these goals, as we did not account for the time it would take for us to fix our proposal and determine a viable alternative uncovered algorithm. Next week, we plan to construct our directed, unweighted graph and implement the union-find algorithm. This week, the specific tasks each member accomplished are the same; we all solely worked on fixing the proposal.

Harsh Agarwal - Fixed the graph algorithm section under proposal.md, specifically the Boruvka's algorithm and its implementation in finding a MST. Also updated the timeline to stay on track throughout the course of the final project. 

Syed Ammar Raza - Wrote the intial graph algorithm section under propsal.md based on the leading question and assisted Harsh on improving it. Updated the time complexity of the algorithms and wrote the advantages of adjacency matrix over adjacency list. Helped research alternate algorithms which we can utilize. 


**April 10th**
Our goal for this week was to write an acceptable proposal, complete data processing, set up our project (e.g. create the Makefile), and begin implementing our covered algorithm and traversal. We did accomplish these goals. Next week, we plan to finish implementing our covered algorithm and traversal. The specific tasks each member accomplished are listed below:

Maya Nayak - Worked on fixing the proposal and began implementing our covered algorithm (Dijkstra)

Syed Ammar Raza - Worked on making the graph using a two dimensional vector and a map.


**April 17th**
Our goal for this week was to implement our covered algorithm. We have yet to extensively determine the algorithm's viability through testing, but we accomplished this goal.

Maya Nayak - Finished implementing Dijkstra and writing Dijkstra test cases.

**April 24th**
Our goal for this week was to implement the graph traversal. We have not done this, and we plan to instead implement the graph traversal and uncovered algorithm simultaneously.

Maya Nayak - Improve Dijkstra time complexity for finding new nodes from v to deg(v) based on project check-in feedback.

**May 1st**
Our goal for this week was to implement IDDFS and the graph traversal, finish creating test cases, and implement the feedback that we received during the mid-project check-in.

Maya Nayak - Changed Dijkstra to better use the makeGraph public interface, fixed Dijkstra edge cases, wrote test cases, implemented IDDFS with Ammar.
